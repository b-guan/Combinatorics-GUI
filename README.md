# Combinatorics-GUI
When given numerical inputs, n and p, the program will create a random diagram that fullfills the following requirements:
				1) There are n nodes
				2) Each pair of nodes has p percent of forming an edge between them
The graphical interface also returns the expected number of triangles that will form, the actual number of triangles formed, and the difference between the two values.
